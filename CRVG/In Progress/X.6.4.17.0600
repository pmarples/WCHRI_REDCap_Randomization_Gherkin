##NOTE##
## Not knowing the correct Gherkin Syntax, I've denoted the lines I think are wrong and I made up "English" with '#EN#' 
##annotations so they are easier to find when someone goes through to correct the Gherkin
## The English lines with a single "#" annotation are meant to stay in the Gherkin script as comments.
